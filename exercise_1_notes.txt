1. What do you think it will output when run?
- I expect for a to print 100 times, b to print 100 times, then c to print 100 times.

2. Does the output match your expectations? 
- No! The join methods are used after all three threads begin executing causing them to overlap.

3. Run the program several more times.  What do you notice?
- The order that the letters are printing are unpredictable because all three threads are running concurrent. Execution of the threads are jumping back and forth between one another.

4. When execution reaches LINE A, how many threads are running?
- 4 threads are running when execution reaches LINE A. The cout is in it's own thread then t_1, t_2, t_3 are in their own thread.

5. Comment out one of the join() lines, recompile, and rerun the program.  What happened? 
- The program fails to run due to SIGABRT - Abort (abnormal termination) signal.

6. Why? 
- When we reach the end of the program while we are still executing a thread.

7. Run ls in the ./build directory.  What are those new files?  Uncomment the line.
- The new files are from the core being dumped.

8. Assuming that we donâ€™t care about the exact ordering of the letters, are there any problems with this code?
- No
