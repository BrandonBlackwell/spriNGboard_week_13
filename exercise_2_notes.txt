1. Why are counter and counter_mutex being passed by reference to the threads?
- We want the threads to manipulate the original counter variable.

2. How long (approximately) will it take the test to run? 
- 1 second

3. Will it pass?
- No

4. Do the outputs and times match your previous expectations? 
- My expectation for the counter was: counter > 3000. My expectation for the time was: time >= 1.0sec. 

5. Does the test pass? 
- Yes, all tests pass. 

6. How long does it take to run?
- 3.295s

7. Does the test pass?
- Yes, test still passes.

8. How long does it take to run?
- About 1 - 1.1 secs

9. What does this say about which code should be inside critical sections?
- Using code inside critical sections makes a drastic difference in efficiency. It can really slow your program down if done incorrectly.
